## 🏗️ Projects

| Project Name              | Focus              | Highlights                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Anomaly Detection in Seismic Data (MSc Research Project)** | AI Engineer | Built an autoencoder + Random Forest pipeline on Raspberry Shake seismic data to detect anomalies. Achieved ROC-AUC ~0.72 (F1=0.79). Applied t-SNE and feature importance to interpret latent space. |
| **NLP Sentiment Analyzer** | ML / NLP Developer | Implemented two traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) and two deep learning models (MLP, CNN, BERT) on IMDB reviews. Evaluated with ROC-AUC and PR-AUC curves. |
| **Road Safety Analytics** | Data Scientist | Analyzed UK accident data using SQL, Apriori, clustering, and SARIMA forecasting. Identified time-based accident patterns and vehicle–pedestrian trends.|
| **Emergency Vehicle Image Classifier** | Computer Vision Engineer | Developed and tuned a CNN to classify emergency vs. non-emergency vehicles. Optimized dropout, filters, and batch sizes.|
| **Video Game Sales Forecasting** | ML Practitioner | Built regression models and Random Forests to predict sales. Used k-Means clustering and ANN tuning to reveal trends across platforms/regions. |
| **Mock Census Data Analysis** | Data Analyst | Cleaned and analyzed simulated 1881 UK census data with Pandas & Seaborn. Produced demographic and housing insights for urban planning. |
| **Characterisation of Gully Erosion in Calabar Municipal (Nyahasang)** | GIS Researcher | Used ArcGIS/QGIS to map, classify, and assess erosion severity. Investigated contributing environmental factors and proposed mitigation strategies. |
| **GitHub Portfolio** | Full-stack Learner | Personal repository showcasing projects, skills, and reports using Markdown and GitHub Pages. |
